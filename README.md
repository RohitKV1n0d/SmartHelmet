# SmartHelmet

Looking on to one the major factor of road accidents , Inadequate Post-Crash Care  is a major are which could be improved .
The Idea is to introduce a  Accident Detection System onto the helmet that can provide the following functions :
Accident Detection : Detects accident when a sudden changes in acceleration is 
detected by using set of accelerometer.

Sends GPS location : Collects Data of the position of incident using GPS .

Sends Alert to nearby Medical services and Traffic Control : The collected data is then send 		to nearby Hospital or any emergency centers for immediate help for the victim of 			the accident . By the time the hospital is ready with the ambulance ,the alert received by the traffic control will help clear a fast route to the accident .

This should be able to drastically reduce the reaction time to the accident and there by improving post-crash care. This can ensure less deaths due to road accidents.
This could be more useful in remote areas where an accident might even go unnoticed.
And places like adventurousness spots which many motorcyclist are attracted to can have rough terrain which is mostly hilly areas and medical support there would be weak.
With the smart helmet we could provide immediate medical help to places where	an accident might go unnoticed .
